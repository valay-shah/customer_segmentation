## Description
This project helps to segment the customers based on their buying habits and thus focus on the customers specifically.

## Dataset
I was handed this project by one of the company. You can find the csv file in the folder

## Method
- The customers can be segmented using K-means clustering algorithm. 
- Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.
- It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible.
